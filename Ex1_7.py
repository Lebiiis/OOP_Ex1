# Description:  Process with an arithmetic progression (AP) 2, 4, 6, ... . The maximum value of the AP is obtained from
#               the user. Countthe number of terms that appeared in the AP,
#               the sum of the terms and the sum of the squaredterms. Use functions in your solution.

# Ask user the max value of AP, store starting numbers into variables

maxval = int(input("Max value? "))
